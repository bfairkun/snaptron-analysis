This analysis was a meta-analysis of all the blood or bone marrow samples I could find in snaptron splice-junction count tables. This amounts to ~6000 samples across TCGA, SRA2, and GTEx. The count table I will load is only the subset of junctions within 1000bp of a sf3b1 differentially spliced intron from Darman et al.
