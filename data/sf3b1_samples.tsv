The PCR-amplified RNA-seq library products were then quantified using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (catalog number DNF-479). The samples were diluted to 10 nanomolar in Qiagen Elution Buffer (Qiagen material number 1014609), denatured, and loaded at 2.75 picomolar on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in Rapid Run mode using TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster Kit  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HS (catalog number PE-402-4001) and TruSeq Rapid SBS Kit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HS (200 cycle) reagents (catalog number FC-402-4001). The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced at 100 base-pair paired-end with a 7-base-pair index using the standard Illumina primers. The sequence intensity files were generated on the instrument using the Illumina Real Time Analysis software.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578 leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-mRNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Overall design: In order to understand how RBM15 regulates RNA metabolism, we used a leukemia cell line (MEG-01 cell) to establish stable cell lines with RBM15 knockdown. For RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, normal immunoglobulin was used as controls for sample 1,2; and anti-RBM15 antibody was used for samples 3,4.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

Part of the explanation probably lies in differences in chromatin organization between exons and introns. Proteomic, co-immunoprecipitation, and sedimentation analyses described here indicated that SF3B1, an essential splicing component of the U2 snRNP complex, is strongly associated with nucleosomes. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed that SF3B1 is specifically bound to nucleosomes located at exonic positions. SF3B1 binding is enriched at nucleosomes positioned over short exons flanked by long introns that are also characterized by differential GC content between exons and introns. Disruption of SF3B1 binding to such nucleosomes affected the splicing of these exons similarly to inhibition of SF3B1 expression. Our findings suggest that the association of SF3B1 with nucleosomes is functionally important for splice site recognition and that SF3B1 conveys splicing-relevant information embedded in chromatin structure. Overall design: MNase-seq on Input and SF3B1 pull-down, mRNA-seq on control and SF3B1 si-RNA treated cells as well as on TSA (Trichostatin A) treated and untreated cells.

We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578 leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-mRNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Overall design: In order to understand how RBM15 regulates RNA metabolism, we used a leukemia cell line (MEG-01 cell) to establish stable cell lines with RBM15 knockdown. For RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, normal immunoglobulin was used as controls for sample 1,2; and anti-RBM15 antibody was used for samples 3,4.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC.

We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578 leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-mRNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Overall design: In order to understand how RBM15 regulates RNA metabolism, we used a leukemia cell line (MEG-01 cell) to establish stable cell lines with RBM15 knockdown. For RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, normal immunoglobulin was used as controls for sample 1,2; and anti-RBM15 antibody was used for samples 3,4.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

Part of the explanation probably lies in differences in chromatin organization between exons and introns. Proteomic, co-immunoprecipitation, and sedimentation analyses described here indicated that SF3B1, an essential splicing component of the U2 snRNP complex, is strongly associated with nucleosomes. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed that SF3B1 is specifically bound to nucleosomes located at exonic positions. SF3B1 binding is enriched at nucleosomes positioned over short exons flanked by long introns that are also characterized by differential GC content between exons and introns. Disruption of SF3B1 binding to such nucleosomes affected the splicing of these exons similarly to inhibition of SF3B1 expression. Our findings suggest that the association of SF3B1 with nucleosomes is functionally important for splice site recognition and that SF3B1 conveys splicing-relevant information embedded in chromatin structure. Overall design: MNase-seq on Input and SF3B1 pull-down, mRNA-seq on control and SF3B1 si-RNA treated cells as well as on TSA (Trichostatin A) treated and untreated cells.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

The standard RNA fragmentation profile was used as recommended by Illumina (94 degrees Celsius for 8 minutes). The PCR-amplified RNA-seq library products were then quantified using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (catalog number DNF-479). The samples were diluted to 10 nanomolar in Qiagen Elution Buffer (Qiagen material number 1014609), denatured, and loaded at 2.75 picomolar on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in Rapid Run mode using TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster Kit  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HS (catalog number PE-402-4001) and TruSeq Rapid SBS Kit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HS (200 cycle) reagents (catalog number FC-402-4001). The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced at 100 base-pair paired-end with a 7-base-pair index using the standard Illumina primers. The sequence intensity files were generated on the instrument using the Illumina Real Time Analysis software. The intensity files were demultiplexed and fastq files created using the CASAVA 1.8.2 software suite.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA-sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared to wildtype cases include genes involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1, CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7, SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8, HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. Our data indicate that SF3B1 plays a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation, four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation and five healthy controls.

SF3B1, the most frequently mutated component of the spliceosome in cancer, is involved in the recognition of the branch point sequence (BPS) during selection of the 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ splice site (ss) in RNA splicing. Here, we report that common and tumor-specific splicing aberrations are induced by SF3B1 mutations and establish aberrant 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ss selection as the most frequent splicing defect. Strikingly, mutant SF3B1 utilizes a BPS that differs from that used by wild-type SF3B1 and requires the canonical 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ss to enable aberrant splicing during the second step. Approximately 50% of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of gene and protein expression. These findings ascribe functional significance to the consequences of SF3B1 mutations in cancer.
